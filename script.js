                In the melody of life, you are my harmonious note, painting my world with joy. Your     laughter is a serenade, your eyes, constellations I get lost in. Each shared moment is a    cherished memory, and my love for you transcends time and distance. Until destiny unites   our hands, you are deeply and unequivocally loved.
